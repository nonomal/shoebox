# Introduction to Shoebox

Shoebox is a digital solution for organizing and preserving your videos over a lifetime.

## The Digital Shoebox Concept

Remember how previous generations kept their memories in physical shoeboxes at their parents' homes? Those boxes filled with photographs, negatives, and mementos that captured life's precious moments.

Shoebox aims to recreate that experience for the digital age. Instead of photos getting lost in the endless stream of cloud services or social media platforms, Shoebox provides a dedicated space for your videos - a digital equivalent of that cherished box in your closet.

## What Makes Shoebox Different

**Shoebox is not trying to compete with immich, Google Photos, or other photo management services.**

The main purpose of Shoebox is to help you:

- **Find original videos** export(copy) to a defined location, allowing you to easily import into a video editor of choice. Create highlights, collages, etc.
- **Organize your videos** over a lifetime for easy recall and future use. Have a coffee, review new videos cataloguing your memories as your kids grow.
- **Preserve video memories** in a way that makes them accessible and workable

While other services focus on viewing and sharing, Shoebox focuses on organization and preservation with the specific goal of making your video content useful for future creative projects.
